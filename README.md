# Dicore Language

Dicore is a simple programming language designed to demonstrate the fundamentals of compiler construction, parsing, and code generation using LLVM. It currently supports basic numeric expressions and basic structure for further development.

## Current Syntax

At this stage, Dicore supports only basic numeric expressions. The syntax is minimal but can be extended to support more complex features like functions and variables.

### Supported Features:
- **Numbers**: You can use integers and floating-point numbers directly.
  - Example: `42`, `3.14`

- **Basic Operators**: The language supports basic arithmetic operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.
  - Example: `3 + 5`

### Example Code

```plaintext
3 + 5
